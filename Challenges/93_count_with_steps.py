  93) Create a program with a procedure called Counter() that takes three values as parameters:
  the start, the end, and the step of a count. 
  The main program should request these values from the user and pass them to the procedure,
  which will then display the count on the screen.
   Example:
   For the input values: start (4), end (20), and step (3), calling Counter(4, 20, 3) will display:
   4 >> 7 >> 10 >> 13 >> 16 >> 19 >> END
