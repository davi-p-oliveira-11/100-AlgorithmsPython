   94) [CHALLENGE] Develop an application with a procedure called Fibonacci() that takes a single 
  integer parameter, indicating how many terms of the sequence should be displayed on the screen. 
  The procedure should receive this value and display the requested number of elements.

  Example:

  Fibonacci(5) will generate: 1 >> 1 >> 2 >> 3 >> 5 >> END
  Fibonacci(9) will generate: 1 >> 1 >> 2 >> 3 >> 5 >> 8 >> 13 >> 21 >> 34 >> END
